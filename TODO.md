## To-Do

* Currently working on improving the menu option - The no argument option of `tfflick`. It displays ok when the Powershell window is fully expanded. If the window is not in full mode, the top part of the list is not visible, in this case is better to use the option `tfflick {version number}` 
* Make available for Windows 32 bit architecture - availability to download the 32 bit version of the Terraform executable
* Provide Un-installer option
* Improve menu option - The no argument option of `tfflick`
* Tidy up
